This ATM system has two main classes:

1. **Account Class**: Stores account details (account number, PIN, balance) and provides methods to check balance, deposit, and withdraw, ensuring sufficient funds for withdrawals.

2. **ATM Class**: Manages user interactions, offering options to withdraw, deposit, and check balance. It authenticates users via account number and PIN, validates transactions, and displays success or error messages based on transaction outcomes.

Together, these classes simulate a simple ATM interface with secure access and transaction handling.
